Recommendation strategy:
- track user view post -> send batch api -> db batch write post_view -> get post based on time, likes, comment, interaction history:
	+ liked, commented post: not recommend again
	+ viewed post: now - last_seen_at >= 2 day
	+ ordered by day(post.created_at) desc, (p.likes * 2 + p.comments) desc.
	+ query order: get time-satisfactory posts then order
