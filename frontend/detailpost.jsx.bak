            </p>
            <p>Its easy to look at successful people and think:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Must be nice.”</li>
              <li>“Mustve had connections.”</li>
              <li>“Mustve known what they were doing.”</li>
              <li>“I could never achieve that.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              But the truth is, most of them started where you are now. <br />
              Getting rejected. Wondering if they should give up.
            </p>
            <p>
              But they didnt stop. <br />
              They kept showing up. <br />
              They kept failing, learning and adapting.
            </p>
